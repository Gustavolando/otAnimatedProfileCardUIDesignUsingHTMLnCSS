## Animated Profile Card UI Design using HTML & CSS

This is an even fancier and dynamic profile card with a smooth and neat animated transformation and cool color composition. 

I practiced here box model sizes, design-color composition, rotation animations and filter effects.

Simple and neat HTML and CSS code.
